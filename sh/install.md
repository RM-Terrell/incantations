# Installing custom bash scripts

## If using zsh

Open up your `.zshrc` file and add the following line (you can easily get the path in vscode by right clicking the file tab and clicking "Copy Path"):

```bash
source /path/to/clone/location/incantations/sh/custom_scripts.sh
```

Restart your shell.
